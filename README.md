#How to count cards

In the game of Black Jack, each card that is dealt is one less card that can be dealt. This has an impact on the odds of winning in the game. When more high cards, 10 - Ace, are still in the remaining cards that can be dealt, this increases the chances for the player to receive a winning hand. When more low cards, cards 2-6, are still remaining in the cards that can be dealt, the chances for the dealer to receive a winning hand are increased. The cards 7, 8, and 9 are considered to favor neither the dealer or the player.

One of the most effective methods for counting cards and knowing when there is an advantage or disadvantage for the player is called the High-low strategy. This method assigns the value of +1 for low cards, 2-6, a value of 0 for neutral cards, and a value of -1 for high cards.
